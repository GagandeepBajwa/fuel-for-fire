# Directed Study

## Setup

Assuming you already have a decent grasp of Python, a favourite editor to work in, and a healthy amount of passion, we can get started.

First things first, you're going to need [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

_Note: If you're strapped for storage and prefer something lighter weight, go with [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)._

Download for the appropriate operating system and follow the installation instructions.
